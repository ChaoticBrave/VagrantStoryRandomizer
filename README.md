# Vagrant Story Randomizer
A tool which will randomize a copy of Vagrant Story.

At the moment, this is in the form of a Python file which has been converted to an executable file. It will also only randomize the enemies right now. Item randomization is the next area which is to be addressed.
# Using this GitHub project
Many can find these GitHubs tedious, myself included. The "Releases" folder exists for those who just want to extract the ZIP and get into the action. For those who wish to make their own alterations, the Python file has been included.

If you wish to convert an altered py file into an exe, make sure that your exe is in the same directory as the ZONES and MAPS directories, as well as a psx-mode2-en exe file after conversion in order for it to work. 
# Limitations
As mentioned earlier, this tool can only randomize enemies right now. 

Enemies can also only be changed to those which can be found within the same area. For example, Snowfly Forest opponents can only be swapped with other Snowfly Forest opponents.
