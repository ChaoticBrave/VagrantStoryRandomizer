# Vagrant Story Randomizer
A tool which will randomize a copy of Vagrant Story. Right now, it will randomize the enemies, their drops and chest items.

A randomized game has been proven to work with both Beetle PSX and DuckStation. 
## Releases
Both stable and experimental builds can be found here:

https://mega.nz/folder/wFV3CTzQ#NPZK8E4Wy-c_98T4n2DMTQ

## Updates
The latest experimental build from a year ago now has MSVCP140D.dll included. It will be v.0.5.0.2 in the Experimental folder.

It's been brought to my attention that there has been a bug with seed saving where characters will be cut off when using a custom seed. I apologise and this will be fixed as soon as possible. Please refrain from using the "Enter Seed" button for now.

## To Do
* Make the enemy drops randomizer independent from the enemy randomizer.
* Provide an option to clear an entered seed.
* Randomize enemy stats.
* Randomize Ashley's starting data.
* Last-ditch effort to change which models enemies and Ashley use,

## Using this GitHub project
Many can find these GitHubs tedious, myself included. The "Releases" section exists for those who just want to extract the ZIP and get into the action. For those who wish to make their own alterations, the C++ files have been included.

If you make any alterations to the source code and you want to bring your project to life, make sure that your exe is in the same directory as the ZONES and MAPS directories, as well as a psxinject exe file and its necessary dll files after conversion in order for it to work. 
## What are the parameters available?
* Enemies: Randomizes the enemy placements within an area.
* Chests: Randomizes the contents of a chest.
* Drops: Randomizes what each enemy drops. This will only apply to the random drops of an enemy. Guaranteed drops are unaltered to prevent softlocks.
* Balance Item Stats: Makes the randomized stats of weapons, blades, grips, gems, shields, and armour in chests less extreme.
* Area Progression: Randomizes where you go next depending on the area you're in.
* Keep Item Stats: Prevents the stats of weapons, blades, grips, gems, shields, and armour in chests from being randomized.  

## Limitations
Enemies can also only be changed to those which can be found within the same area. For example, Snowfly Forest opponents can only be swapped with other Snowfly Forest opponents.

Player character randomization was previously in the To Do list. Upon further testing, this will not be possible for the foreseeable future. If only because randomized characters are glitchy outside of battle mode. Should anyone still be interested though, this will be added in a later experimental build.

Certain locations are randomized rather than being on a room-by-room basis due to issues with how coordinates are translated from the ROM to the RAM. Because of this, only a selected few areas can be warped to with the locations randomizer. Locations which end with a door locked by a key, sigil, or have a cutscene transition won't be randomized as the game will not register the changes made by the tool.

* Christo: For the idea of creating a randomizer in the first place.
* CUE: For the psx-mode2 tool in the earlier builds. The project would've been lost without it.
* gingerbeardman: For letting me use his translation of psx-mode2 for the earlier builds.
* cebix: Creator of psximager, which is used for mpd file replacement in builds starting from v0.3.0.0.
* NoharOSP: For being at hand to test this locally.
* The Xenogears Perfect Works Build team: For very kindly providing the patcher code which is used in the GUI.
* mayaktheunholy: For discovering several errors with pre-0.5.1.0 builds.
* OddKara: Inspired me to do location-based randomizing rather than a room-by-room direction.
* benjamin champion: Discovered that grips can be randomized in chests.
* Taterz: Discovered the Ghost crashes in the Catacombs, as well as several other bugs.
* Optrin: For discovering dll dependency errors and several other bugs.
